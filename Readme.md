<b>What is WebRocketX?</b>

WebRocketX is a browser side javascript API that all async calls to the server are made through.  It's primary mechanism of updating
the page is through DOM insertion of HTML snippets using the <a href="https://webrocketx.com/innerHTML.html">innerHTML</a> property.  By having
a single point of interaction with the server the developer has the following functionality provided by the API.
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Browser side control of user interaction during the async call</li>
    <li>Browser side error handling of server side exceptions</li>
    <li>Browser side view caching ~ Easily make the back button work perfectly.</li>
    <li>Browser side view navigation</li>
</ul>

<b>Why the X?</b>
<br/><br/>
WebRocketX is a hybrid.  It is a solution halfway between the old world of 
<a href="https://webrocketx.com/fullPageRefresh.html">full page refresh</a>                
websites and recent 
<a href="https://webrocketx.com/json.html">JSON</a>                 
JSMVC solutions, like Angular.
<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Like full page architecture, WebRocketX expects layout coming from the server to include data. This is different than JSMVC architecture where data is delivered separately from the layout in JSON objects. However, WebRocketX does support JSON when needed, but is not a JSON centric paradigm.</li>
    <li>Like JSMVC architecture, WebRocketX is a <a href="https://webrocketx.com/singlePageApplication.html">Single Page web Application</a> (SPA) and relies on AJAX calls to submit data and bring in new views.</li>
</ul>
